  ## Description
  This application allows the user to keep track of transactions.  It enables the user to input and name deposits and withdrawals from a virtual account, retain records of each transaction, and see a visual representation of the history of the account balance.  Additionally, the application will still function without an internet connection.

  ## Installation
  
  The project requires the node packages express, morgan, mongoose, and compression.  If trying to run a similar project locally, the user would have to also have MongoDB installed on his or her system to store entered data.
  
  ## Usage
  
  If the user wishes to run the project locally, he or she will need to have installed the aforementioned node packages (and MongoDB), and he or she will either have to use the default named database - over-under - or pick an alternate name and insert it in the server.js file.  Additionally, the default port that the application runs on is 3101.  Should the user wish to change this, he or she will also have to update this in the server.js file.  Once everything is set, the user must input the command 'npm start' from the command line in the root of the project to start the server.  Then, the user can navigate to localhost:<port> to begin using the application.  If the user wishes to used the deployed version, he or she can navigate to the deployed link found elsewhere in this file.
